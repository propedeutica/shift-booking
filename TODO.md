#List of things to do: Please look at Issues for an up to date list:

    ~~Devise for users~~
    ~~Devise for admins~~
    ~~Create offspring and assign them to shifts~~
    ~~ Improvement in reports to show users and offspring, and assignments (i.e. showing admins all the information)~~
    Admins should be able to modify users
    Change to nested routes to reflect structure (non-authenticated, user-authenticated, admin-authenticated)
    ~~Translation into Spanish~~
    ~~Installation instructions (configuration options)~~
    Mail for Devise
    Mail for all other events
    Allow admin to see the interface as one of the users (impersonate a user)
    100% test coverage (expect action-job not to be there)

Thank you for taking the time to help :D
