%h2 Introduction
%p
  This application tries to make it possible to reserve places in a school where the users are not capable of doing on their own (because they are under age).
  Parents can sign up with their won data and then add their offspring.
  Once that is done they can ask for a particular shift where they want their offspring to be assigned.
%p
It is also a technology example for the following:

%h2 Description
%p
  Shift reservation is a simple program to make it possible distributed assignment of shifts to students that can not do it by themselves,
  and need their parents to do it in their behalf.
  There are different rooms that hold classes in parallel, and each of those rooms have a group of shift.
  A new student needs to be assigned to one of the shifts for the full course.
  Rooms have a capacity, but some of the shifts can have some places reserved (prebooked) for different reasons,
  and the parent is free to choose any shift that has some free space left.
%p
  This does not take into account that the parents can need

%h3 Users
%p
  Users are identified as parents.
  They can add and delete offspring and assigning them so a shift.
  Only one parent is in the system, and there is no option for two parents (although it could be added).
  They can sign up and add children into the system, and they can assign those children to shifts that has some space available.
  They can also delete those children from the system.
  The amount of information requested is the minimum possible.
%h3 Offsprings
%p
  Offsprings are related to parents and they are the subject that is assigned to a shift. An offspring is assigned to a single shift for the year.
%h3 Room and shift
%p
  There are different rooms that can be assigned. Each one has different shifts that corresponds to a group of students and a teacher.
%p
  An offspring can only be assigned to a shift in a single room. Trying to add another will result in the first one being deleted.
